# hello-world
A hello world repository for ideas and random stuff.

My name is Ryan and I like to code things; things like games, apps, and websites (like this one!)

I like to code and use a variety of languages, tools, and frameworks such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, PHP, AJAX, Bootstrap, SASS/LESS, C#, JAVA, Python, and Ruby.

Welcome to my site; where I show and tell my work to the world. Have a look around, get to know me and see what I can do. Checking out the projects I have released, the tools I make for fun, and things I write about in my blog.

If you would like me to work with you get in touch
